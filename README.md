SDF Project all of the files are in there you just need to uncompress it 
since the Github not allowing me to upload it all in one go so i compress it into RAR file 

Download it guys and try to run it if its ok or not 

note: You need to have MS SQL running and connect it to the Specific Database Server we currently have
for the database we have to run smoothly. more update to come! Stand by.
